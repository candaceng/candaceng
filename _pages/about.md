### A little bit about myself
Hi! My name is Candace Ng and I'm student at the University of Waterloo based in Markham, Ontario. I'm working towards a Biomedical Engineering degree with a minor in Mathematics and an Artificial Intelligence option. Prior to entering this big chapter of my life, I was a competitive swimmer for 8 years and competed at the national level. I've always loved playing sports and being active in general, and with that comes a big appetite for good food. I will never say no to two things: sushi or anything matcha flavoured. Recently Hokkaido milk tea has also become a strong contender for joining the list. Now that I think about it maybe I should just move to Japan...

### What I've recently been up to
Given the current state of the world, a lot of my free time is spent at home. Besides school and co-op, I've also taken advantage of the online courses that were made available to students around the world. In particular, I've developed a passion for machine learning and data science, and you can check out my latest projects [here]({% link _pages/portfolio.md %}). 

I love programming - and through the practice of documenting my code, I've dabbled into creating articles about concepts I find interesting. You can check out these tutorials [here]({% link _pages/tutorials.md %}).
